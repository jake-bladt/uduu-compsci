# Self-Directed Computer Science curriculum

## Purpose

This document is meant to give structure to a self-study in computer science based on personal career and life goals. It will draw heavily
from [Forrest Knight's Open Source CS curriculum](https://github.com/jake-bladt/open-source-cs) and 
[the OSSU computer science course](https://github.com/jake-bladt/computer-science).
