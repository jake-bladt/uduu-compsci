# Self-Directed Computer Science curriculum

## Purpose

This document is meant to give structure to a self-study in computer science based on personal career and life goals. It will draw heavily
from [Forrest Knight's Open Source CS curriculum](https://github.com/jake-bladt/open-source-cs) and 
[the OSSU computer science course](https://github.com/jake-bladt/computer-science).

Because this is entirely self-directed and not certification seeking, it's focused primarily on three areas of study:

* Subject matter underlying what I already know - theory and math
* Material that has a high probability of being professionally valuable in the next twenty years of my career
* Matieral that will allow me to build systems outside of my professional track, but which can serve the greater good
* Material that can make me more of a "well-rounded developer."

Because I've been a professional software developer for 20+ years, these requirements are markedly different from what a traditional college freshman would find educationally valueable.
