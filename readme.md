# Self-Directed Computer Science curriculum

## Purpose

This document is meant to give structure to a self-study in computer science based on personal career and life goals. It will draw heavily
from [Forrest Knight's Open Source CS curriculum](https://github.com/jake-bladt/open-source-cs) and 
[the OSSU computer science course](https://github.com/jake-bladt/computer-science).

Because this is entirely self-directed and not certification seeking, it's focused primarily on three areas of study:

* Subject matter underlying what I already know - theory and math
* Material that has a high probability of being professionally valuable in the next twenty years of my career
* Matieral that will allow me to build systems outside of my professional track, but which can serve the greater good
* Material that can make me more of a "well-rounded developer."

Because I've been a professional software developer for 20+ years, these requirements are markedly different from what a traditional college freshman would find educationally valueable.

## Math and underlying theory

The OSSU recommendations are very math heavy and, at this point, it's not entirely clear to me whether or not they're needed for anyting I want to create. I'm sure I would benefit from a survey course at least as review of material I covered 30+ years ago. Because I want to at least survey machine learning as a field (and possibly make it my core focus,) I should have an underpinning in statistics and probability. Plenty of the problems I've addressed as a developer required an understanding of graphs, so graph theory is a must. Likewise matrix transformations and linear algebra.

On the other hand, I've encountered differential and integral calculus exactly twice in my career - once to calculate the value of conjoined cashflows (ie stocks that pay dividends) over time and once when my client was considering commissioning his own digital signal processing library, but ultimately decided to buy a third-party library. I'm holding off on adding calculus to this curriculum until I see a need for it.
